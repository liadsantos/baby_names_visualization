Previously, the colorscale was dominated by shades of purple, making it difficult to distinguish variations in popularity for names with counts less then 10,000.

It excels in showcasing the complete picture without overlapping lines, ensuring that each name's popularity is clearly visible and discernible. By utilizing varying colors, the heatmap not only presents the popularity of each name but also enables easy identification and understanding of the trends. This makes it an ideal choice for analyzing the evolution of baby neutral-names, as it provides a comprehensive and visually appealing representation of the data.\n","Anyway, it's important to consider factors such as the size limitations of the visualization with a large number of names and challenges in distinguishing between subtle variations in quantity.\n","\n","In analyzing the data, it is evident that there are gender effects and trends in the popularity of names given to both sexes. Over time, there has been a significant increase of giving neutral names to children. This trend is particularly pronounced in the last period, where we observe a consistent and linear growth in the popularity of neutral names, especially after the **year 1950** (more or less).\n","\n","This increase in the use of neutral names can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the progress in LGBT+ rights and the increasing acceptance and recognition of diverse gender identities have influenced the naming practices. Additionally, the empowerment of women and the blurring of traditional gender roles have also contributed to the rise of neutral names. As societal norms evolve and the distinctions between genders become less rigid, there is a growing tendency to choose names that are not strictly associated with a specific gender.\n","So, the data supports the notion that the popularity of neutral names has been evolving consistently, with a notable surge in recent years. This trend reflects the broader societal changes towards inclusivity and the recognition of diverse gender expressions."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yJhCClfk2UrK"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.11"},"orig_nbformat":4},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
