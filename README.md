# baby_names_visualization

We work with the data set "baby_names", that contains the list of all baby names registered in France, year by year, from 1900 through 2019. The goal is to create three visualizations per each task and implement one of them.

## How the project is organized 

The project is composed of two jupyter notebooks, `visualization_notebook.ipynb`, which contains the sketches and the descriptions of each one for each visualization, and `notebook.ipynb`, which is composed of the implementations of the visualization the group chose to do. To run the project, one must have installed the following libraries:

- Altair: use the features of the library to create the visualization
- Pandas: load and pre-process the dataset

As the altair render does not work entirely well on github, since it is run on Javascript, the visualizations can only be seen if the project is downloaded and run (it does not work on Google Colab).
